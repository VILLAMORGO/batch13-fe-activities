          &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Wanted! is a one-shot manga by Eiichiro Oda, produced during his senior year of high school in 1992. It was submitted - under the pseudonym Tsuki Himizu Kikondo (月火水木金土?) - to the 44th Tezuka Awards and won Second Class, earning Oda ¥500,000 and marking his debut in the manga industry.

        <BR><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Per convention at the time, Wanted! was collected with its fellow winners in a single Mezase Mangaka (めざせ漫画家!?) volume, published in early 1993.[1] After One Piece brought Oda to new prominence, it was reprinted in the September 1998 issue of Akamaru Jump, followed by a self-titled collection dedicated to one-shots from Oda's early career.

        <BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The story opens with Wild Joe, a bounty hunter, going after the head of the wanted criminal Gill Bastar. It is shown that Gill's huge bounty is due to his killing of many people in self-defense. Ironically the more people he kills, the more he must kill to protect himself. Joe goes in for the kill to claim Gill's bounty, when Gill suddenly points behind Joe in surprise. Joe turns to look, and Gill shoots him in the head, killing him.

        <BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At this point, Joe's ghost starts haunting Gill, as he cannot pass on having been killed in such a cowardly manner. Joe explains to Gill that he plans to possess someone's body to duel him properly and that he will pass on if he loses, or the day Gill dies. He then brings up that that will probably be soon, since the cops have hired the number one hitman Sino Phoenix to to take Gill's head, as Gill's murders have gotten out of hand. This enrages Gill, as he exclaims that all of his kills have been self-defense, that the other guy always shot first, and that he shouldn't even be wanted.

        <BR><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Two days pass and Sino Phoenix is seen sitting in a bar. Gill and Joe enter the bar and sit next to him. After a few seconds, Joe realizes who it is and tells Gill, who panics and runs from the bar unnoticed. Joe says that he's not going let this opportunity to kill Gill pass and possesses Gill. He then forces Gill to walk back to the bar and challenge Sino to a fight. As Gill tries to defend himself by saying it's a joke, Sino says that he hates jokes and shoots at him, knocking off Gill's hat and glasses, revealing his identity to the whole bar. Everyone runs from the bar for fear of getting involved. Sino says that he heard that Gill defeated Joe, to which Gill replies that Joe was just an idiot. Sino likes his reply and the fight begins.

        <BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They trade a few shots at each other and a couple of the townspeople take shots at Gill as well, until Gill gets hit in the arm and hides. Sino tries to think of Gill's plan and states that whatever Gill does is useless, as Sino has won a gun fight against twenty guerrillas before. He is then surprised and shoots at a cat. Gill realizes that if Sino had started off fighting him seriously, that he would have lost due to Sino's fast reflexive shooting. He takes advantage of the situation and throws a rock. Sino immediately shoots at where the rock landed, then Gill distracts him again by knocking some barrels on a roof with rocks. Sino shoots at the barrels, causing them to fall at him. Gill then calls to Sino and shoots him. The villagers spot Gill on a far away rooftop, and all give up on his bounty, declaring him a monster. Sino then sits up in disbelief that he was shot, at which point Gill shoots another barrel, causing it to fall onto Sino.

        <BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Joe then starts passing on, which surprises him. Gill says it's because he's admitted defeat, to which Joe replies that there is no way that he would admit defeat, after all, he was the stronger man. He then disappears, and Gill says that he will see him in the next world, in a hundred years.

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;God's Gift for the Future (神から未来のプレゼント Kami kara Mirai no Purezento?) is a oneshot manga by Eiichiro Oda, originally published in the October 1993 issue of Monthly Shonen Jump Original. It was later reprinted in 1998 as part of Wanted!, a compilation of Oda's pre-One Piece stories.

      <BR><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The main character, Bran, is a pickpocket who although trying to correct his way of life, just cannot stop his "bad habit". God himself decides to kill him and give his soul a strict scolding to prevent him from doing more bad things in his future lives, then plans to kill him with his notebook, in which whatever you write will happen at the exact date and hour that you specify, but instead of writing "A meteorite will hit Bran's house", he accidentally writes "A meteorite will hit Branchi"; Branchi being a big department store. He only notices his error when an angel tells him.

      <BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;God then decides to meet Bran himself and to give him the notebook as "a present" without saying anything more. Bran then discovers the uses of the notebook, as casual things of his day were "predicted" inside the notebook. And then he also discovers the last entry: "A meteorite will hit Branchi".

      <BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some hours later, God appears again to speak with Bran, telling him that if he wants to be forgiven and to live, he needs to save the lifes of all the people at Branchi. He also states that only the things written in the notebook with the named "Pen of Fate" will occur. And the only way to reverse it would be to erase what is written with the "Eraser of Fate", but he lost it. Bran then heads to Branchi, while on the way to Branchi, he is stealing a gun from some bodyguards.

      <BR><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He first tries to tell the truth about Branchi, but the CEO (Chief Executive Officer) of the department store just laughs at him. He then decides to enter the radio studio and to tell everybody in the building (using his gun to have the right to do so) that there is a bomb in there and to get out immediately.

      <BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His plan works so well this time that everybody is out even too quickly, leaving only him inside seven minutes before the arriving of the meteorite, so he decides to come out to talk with the media who are already reunited around the entry. Everybody laughs at him when the CEO of the department store recognizes him and talks about the meteorite, forcing him to use his gun (harmlessly) to calm them down. Then, with only a few minutes remaining, a woman notices that her son, Yoshio, is still inside of the building, so Bran dashes in to save him. Finding him at the sixth floor with thirty seconds remaining, Bran jumps through the window with Yoshio in his arms, falling with the meteorite hitting Branchi just behind them. However, they just land safely, surprising all the people who tried to grab them, and after returning Yoshio to his mother, he just walks away saying that they do not need to thank him because "It's Fate".

      <BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Back in Heaven, God and his assistant Angel discuss Bran's good deed and decide not to kill him, God then notices a new entry in the last chapter of the notebook that reveals that Bran had stolen the Pen of Fate from God sometime before returning it and the notebook, and that he had written "Bran jumps and lands with no injury. Happy ending, take that, shitty geezer", leaving both entities impressed with Bran's skills. Bran is last seen continuing his pickpocketing habit.

It won first place in the year's Hop☆Step manga awards. It was later reprinted in 1998 as part of Wanted!, a compilation of Oda's pre-One Piece stories.

      <BR><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The story starts with a monk named Guko walking through a forest looking for a place to spend the night. He then hears someone call him and is seemingly attacked by a monster. Guko promptly runs away and makes his way out of the forest. He sees a village and goes to ask if he can spend the night there. He realizes right when he's asking that they may ask for his help in exterminating that monster he saw earlier, so he just asks if there is a temple nearby that he can do his ascetic practices at. His hunch is correct however, and to his dismay, the entire village asks for his help in slaying the monster cannibal, to which he begrudgingly agrees. The mayor of the village offers to let him stay at his house in the mean time, but the people from the first house he went to say that he needs to stay at the temple for his practices, and thus he is forced to stay there.

      <BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once at the temple he is again seemingly attacked by the monster. He dodges the attack and begs for his life, telling him that he does not taste good. The monster asks him to move so that he can enter his home, the temple, and takes off the monster mask revealing that he is the Guardian Deity of the temple that has been there for three hundred years. He reveals that he was bored recently, so he was scaring humans with that mask to entertain himself.

      <BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The guardian, who had come to the fight scene asked what the monk's name was, as he recognizes the clothes as the clothes of his monk friend. It is revealed that the monk's name was Koshin, and that the cannibal had taken the clothes after eating him. The guardian attacks the cannibal in a rage, but is stopped by Guko who says that he shouldn't kill others in the human world. He then reveals that Koshin is the name of his master that he was looking for. Guko take the guardian's sword, and after a brief fight, cuts the cannibal in half, killing him. From then on, Guko traveled around exterminating monsters with that sword. The people who he saved described him as having a scar on his forehead, and having a sword, even though he's a monk.

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Monsters is a oneshot manga by Eiichiro Oda, originally published in the 1994 Shonen Jump Autumn Special. It was later reprinted in 1998 as part of Wanted!, a compilation of Oda's pre-One Piece stories.

      <BR><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The story starts with the narrator telling the story of a dragon's horn that was stolen 10 years ago. It was the only such thing existing and was said to have wondrous powers. But no one still remembers the incident. In the next scene, someone is being kicked out of a restaurant due to him being unable to pay for his meal. Meanwhile in another restaurant, the waitress Flare recognizes the famous swordsman Cyrano, whom she had encountered before. Their conversation is interrupted by a mad looking guy staring through the window on Cyrano's meal with his stomach rumbling loudly. After Flare gave him something to eat, the samurai Ryuma states that this has been his first meal in five days and offers his gratitude to the young waitress. He claims that a samurai owes his life to his life-saver, but is ignored by Flare who is talking to Cyrano again. When the latter leaves the restaurant, his sword accidentally touches Ryuma's, which the samurai takes as an heavy insult. He challenges Cyrano to a duel-to-the-death. As the two swordsmen engage each other, Ryuma slashes a copper Buddha easily in half. Right before the fight is escalating, Flare tells Ryuma to stop. Much to the viewer's surprise, he follows her order immediately. At the same time, another swordsman called D.R. arrives at the city.

      <BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Later on, Ryuma is seen sitting at the bar learning from the bartender the story of Flare's hometown. Seven years ago, the village in the mountains Flare lived in was suddenly attacked by a huge dragon. The only survivors were Flare and Cyrano, who saved the girl from the flames of the burning village. This event established Cyrano's reputation as hero and great swordsman. After listening to her story, Ryuma has great respect for Flare, who he thinks of as a very brave girl. He then has a chat with the bartender about "The King", who is supposed to be the greatest swordsman alive, with Ryuma expressing the intention of fighting "The King" one day, since he believes "The King" has the soul of a real fighter. After finishing his meal, Ryuma decides to continue traveling. As he is walking down the street, Ryuma's sheath is seen yet again knocking against D.R.'s. As Ryuma is calling the man for touching his sword, D.R. suddenly starts to scream and accuses Ryuma of stabbing him. While Ryuma is completely confused by the situation, D.R. further accuses him of wanting the Dragon Horn he allegedly stole. He then decides to blow the horn in order to summon a dragon to destroy the whole town. He then breaks the horn and apparently dies. The surrounding crowd blames Ryuma for their misfortune and becomes violent towards him when Flare appears. Much to Ryuma's surprise, she gives him a slap in the face and calls him a murderer for causing the situation. Remembering her former encounter to a dragon, she states that he can't imagine how terrible a dragon really is, because if he did, he wouldn't have done something that stupid. Ryuma still doesn't get the situation at all and refuses to take responsibility. Cyrano however confirms that the horn is real and asks everyone to leave the town immediately. He wants to fight with the dragon on his own though Flare is begging him not to do so. Although Ryuma is stating that it is stupid to risk his life just for a few houses, Cyrano sticks to his decision. The town's inhabitants are still mad at Ryuma, telling him to commit Harakiri, but he is stopped by Cyrano.

      <BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Later on, all the town's inhabitants have fled except for Flare and Ryuma who are talking in the restaurant. Ryuma doesn't understand why Flare is so frightened since Cyrano is supposed to be a really good swordsman. When Flare, haunted by her memories, storms off in order to stop Cyrano, Ryuma follows her outside. As they stop running and begin arguing again, Ryuma suddenly freezes in shock and tries to prevent Flare from turning around. As he fails, the two of them watch Cyrano helping D.R. looting the town. It turns out that Cyrano and D.R. were partners from the start and they trapped Ryuma in order to blame him for the incident with the dragon. It is revealed that they were also responsible for the attack that happened seven years ago. Back then, D.R. summoned a dragon in order to destroy the village with the Dragon Horn that Cyrano had stolen from his own subordinates. Flare encountered Cyrano in the middle of the flames and begged him for help. Instead, he killed her father while she was unconscious and decided to use Flare in order to gain prestige for his name.

      <BR><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Ryuma and Flare are hiding behind a house, Flare tells him that staying any longer would be suicide as a dragon was still coming to destroy the town. She tells him to immediately leave the town, but instead of fleeing herself she returns to her place and breaks down in tears. Ryuma, who has followed her again and witnesses her tears and screams from outside, runs off to confront Cyrano and D.R. When he faces the two criminals, he states that he knew someone who would knock against another sword so thoughtlessly could never have a true fighter's soul. As Cyrano mocks Ryuma and finally attacks him, the latter kills him with one strike. D.R., frightened by this turn of events, pleads for his life by offering Ryuma the real Dragon Horn in order to stop the dragon from destroying the town. Ryuma just tells him that he is not an inhabitant of this town and draws his sword. Just as the dragon arrives, Flare is seen sitting on a rooftop, preparing to die together with the town. By then, she realizes Ryuma is confronting the dragon. The samurai jumps from a building and beheads the beast with one mighty swing. As Ryuma is leaving the town after the battle, he meets Flare again. When he passes her by, he tells her to stop thinking about dying as he believes dying isn't fun at all. When Flare asks him why he isn't famous at all, he just states that reputation isn't important in a fight but what you are protecting with it. As a farewell, he tells Flare that she owes one to him now and that he will return in order to have a meal. Later on, as the inhabitants of the town are returning to their houses, Flare learns from the bartender that Ryuma is actually called "The King" and that this name was given to him by those he had saved. He is believed to be the world's best swordsman.

      <BR><p>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Romance Dawn, Version 1 refers to the first of a series known as Romance Dawn, which one might call a One Piece prototype. This, the initial telling of "Romance Dawn," is 50 pages in length, and was first published as a one-shot in the Shōnen Jump 1996 Summer Special (an issue dedicated to the work of up-and-coming artists) on 4 August. One Piece fans sometimes refer to it as "Chapter 0" in the context of the series, because it is called this in One Piece Red: Grand Characters, where it is reprinted in its entirety along with a page of commentary by the author. An animated version of this story was made as part of a special OVA commemorating the 40th anniversary of Shonen Jump, in which One Piece is serialized. In the December 2009 issue of Shonen Jump, the one shot appeared in the magazine translated legally for the first time in America.

      <BR><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The story opens with young pirate Monkey D. Luffy spotting a pirate ship in the distance, and setting his skiff, the Märchen (adorned with 4 different pirate flags), after it. Meanwhile, the residents of a town on the shore are panicking as they realize that the pirate ship of "Crescent-Moon Gally" is approaching. The mayor advocates paying off the pirates to save their town without a fight, but the townspeople argue that money will not be enough. Still, armed resistance would be too reckless to try. A young, sword-carrying woman named Silk speaks up, saying that they should fight, but the townspeople dismiss her, telling her that it would only make the problem a larger one. She resists this argument, but the mayor tells them that he will attempt to speak to the pirates while the rest of the town stays safe. As the pirate ship arrives, the townspeople panic at the figure, whom they believe to be Gally. Luffy, however, has subdued Gally and his crew, and is now looking for somewhere to eat. Gally claims that he was only caught off-guard, and demands to know what Luffy thinks he's doing, but the young man replies that he did not want to fight, but Gally's men gave him no choice. Gally responds by saying that Luffy's made an enemy of one of the three most fearsome pirates there are, but realizes mid-sentence that Luffy is no longer there.

      <BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Luffy walks through the streets of the village, commenting on the lack of people. The mayor approaches him, asking for what he can do for the pirate, and Luffy asks where a restaurant is. The mayor hurriedly directs him to one, but panics after Luffy goes in when he realizes that Silk is also inside. Silk attacks him immediately, but Luffy hurriedly explains that he is not a pirate, but a candidate for one. As Luffy begins to eat, Silk comments on how weak he looked, and asks about Gally's ship. Luffy's attention, however, is solely on his food. Between bites, he begins to tell her how he's going to become a "Peace Main". He explains that there are different kinds of pirates in the world: the ones that go around indiscriminately plundering are called "Morgania," while those who go on lots of adventures are called "Peace Main". He wants to recruit Peace Main crew members, but the world is full of Morgania types, who just want to loot and plunder. He then asks Silk if she has any treasures. When she questions what he means, he tells her that his hat is his treasure, but it's not really his. A long time ago, a Peace Main pirate made the town where he lived his home port... Luffy, as a child, is being made fun of by Red-Haired Shanks and his crew, who tell him that to be a pirate would be fatal for a Hammer like him. Luffy shouts that he will be okay as long as he does not fall overboard, so they should take him on their next voyage. Shanks tells him sure, in 10 years. Shanks admits that Luffy has guts, going out day after day in a boat, but... just then, Luffy eats a fruit he found, and Shanks & crew react with horror. It turns out that the fruit is none other than the "Gomu Gomu no Mi," the fruit of a mysterious tree that grows (or does not) once every 50 years, and which they stole from an enemy ship. Luffy is indifferent until Shanks reveals that because he ate it, he will never be able to swim. Luffy is shocked, but later (after regaining his composure), he rows out into the sea, telling himself that he will be all right as long as he does not fall into the water. Unfortunately, his ship is attacked by a shark, and Luffy calls out for help. He seems just about to be eaten, when Shanks steps in, and tells the shark to get lost. Luffy looks on in horror as he realizes that Shanks also lost his left arm in the process. When it comes time for Shanks and his crew to move on, Luffy begs them to let him come too, but Shanks tells him no. Instead, he leaves his straw hat with Luffy, and tells him to give it back, after he becomes a pirate.

      <BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Back in the present, Silk reveals that she's heard of "Red-Haired Shanks," one of the most famous pirates in existence, but that she has not heard any negative rumors about him. She also tells Luffy that she, herself, is the child of a pirate, though she was abandoned. Although Gally escapes his bonds and attempts to do away with Luffy, he manages to overcome him and sink Gally's ship. The townspeople wish him well as he sails off with a new Jolly Roger atop his mast. Some time later, on a grand-looking pirate ship, two people resembling Silk and Gally wake up their captain and inform him that they've spotted an island. Luffy, looking relaxed as ever and sporting several days' stubble, tells them to head ashore. The narrator informs the reader that the name of "Straw Hat Luffy" will spread far and wide, but that's for another story.

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The story opens with Luffy out at sea on a small skiff, having just woken up from a nap. He hears a noise from above, and a strange bird plummets directly into his boat. He is impressed by its size, and wonders if it's an ostrich, or maybe even a panda. Then he realizes that the bird's arrival has made a decent-sized hole in the boat, so he plugs it with the creature, because he cannot swim if the boat sinks. While examining the animal more closely, he also notices that it's wounded, and wonders how it happened. Suddenly, a huge ship appears next to Luffy's boat, and a voice calls out for "Balloon" to escape, and fly far away. The bird tries to take off, but Luffy holds it firmly in place, reminding it that the current situation in the boat is its fault. A rope ladder is lowered from a ship, and a voice calls out to the young man in the straw hat to bring the bird on board. Once Luffy is on board the ship, a girl named Ann yells at him for bringing Balloon on board, because now it's being held prisoner. Luffy asks if Balloon is that panda, and Ann (who is tied to the mast) angrily tells him it's not a panda. Luffy tells her that it's injured, and Ann remarks that it had been shot by "Spiel the Hexagon", the captain of this ship. He's an unknown among pirates; nobody at Ann's village had heard of him before he attacked. Nevertheless, he can use witchcraft, so the villagers defending their home could not even approach him. Spiel's crew is afraid of him, and Ann's village was looted and plundered because of him. If Luffy tries to fight him, he will be killed..

      <BR><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Spiel appears and congratulates Luffy on capturing the creature, offering his thanks. Luffy answers that Spiel has a weird-looking head. Ann yells at him for not listening to her, while he just tells her to look at him and see. Spiel orders both of them locked up. Ann wants to kill Luffy for what he did, but Luffy just wants to know if the ostrich is hers. Ann corrects him again, telling him that it's a Monster-Bird, and its name is Balloon. It had been with her for as long as she could remember. When she played, and when she slept, it never left her side. When viewed by others, it might look like an ordinary bird, but to her, it's her most important friend, whom she can trust more than anyone else. Luffy asks why Ann was captured, and she says it's because she's cute (Luffy wonders if that's really true). Ann wonders what Luffy was doing out in the middle of the sea in such a small vessel, so he tells her that he's looking for Peace Main to make his crew. Ann does not know what this is; Luffy explains that it's a kind of pirate. The ones on this ship who loot and plunder indiscriminately are called "Morgania," while those who go innocently looking for adventure are called "Peace Main," and Luffy is going to be one. His grandfather was a Peace Main pirate, too.

      <BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a flashback, Luffy's grandfather, laughing loudly, urges the boy to set out to sea when he becomes a man. Luffy refuses, however, because he cannot swim and he hates the sea. His grandfather tells him that he did not raise grandson to be so selfish, but Luffy does not want to be a pirate. Later, Luffy's grandfather's crew argues with him about the distribution of their loot, but he silences those who want more with his fists, telling them they are 100 years too early. He then shows off one of his latest acquisitions to Luffy: the Gomu Gomu Fruit, which he found by chance on an enemy ship, and took for his own. It's the fruit of a mystical tree, and if he sells it, he could get Beli.png5,000,000 for it but Luffy takes it and eats it, commenting on its bad taste, while his grandfather looks on in horror.

        Grabbing his grandson, he shouts that it's the fruit of a devilish tree, and now that Luffy's eaten it, he will never be able to swim. Luffy is shocked, but quickly regains his composure, since it's not like he wanted to be a pirate anyway. Luffy's grandfather is annoyed at his flippant attitude, but brushes it off, since after all, there are lots of people who enjoy not having anything to do with water. At that, Luffy breaks down, revealing that he really did want to be a pirate, but could not say it because he could not swim. He still wants to go out on the sea, and does not want to be dead weight in water all his life. His grandfather is touched by this, but slugs him for taking the sea so lightly. He launches into a speech about how the sea is different from ponds or rivers, and that even he would drown if his ship sank in the middle of the sea, but Luffy interrupts him with a return kick to the face and the two begin to fight.

      <BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Back in the present, Ann seems amused that Luffy cannot swim. Luffy tells her that his hat is the one his violent grandpa always wore, and it's his treasure. He asks Ann what her treasure is, and she says that it's Balloon, but Luffy is distracted by a whale, angering her. Much later, Luffy announces that he's tired of being there, so he's going to go. Ann reminds him that he cant, and Luffy recalls that his ship was broken by the bird. Ann meant that they cannot escape from where they are, but Luffy just squeezes through the bars. Ann is astonished, and yells at him to let her out. She asks him if he can also use witchcraft, but he says no, just something similar. Ann is going to go save Balloon, and asks for Luffy's help, but he refuses, saying that he needs to go find a boat. She takes off on her own, cursing Luffy, while Luffy complains that she said she was afraid of pirates before. On deck, Ann finds the pirates guarding Balloon's cage asleep. She sneaks toward him, but Spiel is watching from the crow's nest. Elsewhere, Luffy is happy to have found both a boat and food. Ann bests the pirates guarding the cage in swordplay, and tells them to free Balloon like they promised, but suddenly one of them is set alight, while Spiel proclaims them scum for being defeated by a woman. Spiel throws the key to Ann, telling her she is free to go, but when she goes to free Balloon, he shoots her. Spiel upbraids her for thinking she could get away, but is interrupted by Luffy appearing with his boat. He asks where Luffy is headed, Luffy replies that his head looks like a water strider. Both the crew and Ann are shocked at Luffy's stupidity. Luffy walks over and asks Ann why she's bleeding, and she replies that it's because she was shot, and she was playing dead until he started talking to her. Spiel takes advantage of the opening by shooting Luffy multiple times, but he bounces the bullets back. Spiel is speechless, Ann wants to know how he did that, and Spiel's crew panics, thinking that Luffy can use witchcraft like their captain. Spiel attempts to crush him with a giant hammer, but Luffy is only annoyed at him. Spiel climbs into the crow's nest and tells the "monster" to stay away, but Luffy tells him he's the one who started it, and at any rate, climbing up there will not help him, which he demonstrates with a long-distance punch that sends Spiel back to the deck. The crew want to know if they are dreaming. Luffy explains that he ate the Gomu Gomu Fruit, which made him into a Rubber Man (in exchange for never being able to swim). This shocks the crew even more, but Spiel tells Luffy to spend his whole life there, stretching and shrinking. Spiel, standing on a broomstick and holding Balloon on a leash, says he has no more use for the ship, because he has the treasure he wanted. He breaks the ship apart with his witchcraft, and departs.

        <BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ann saves Luffy from drowning, and Luffy says he owes her his life. Ann breaks down, and reveals that Balloon was the last of its kind, whose blood is supposed to have magical properties, which is why Spiel wanted it. The real reason that she was captured was because Balloon will always come back to her. She despairs about her most important friend, wishing it did not have to be rare, or magical, but Luffy tells her not to give up hope yet. Luffy wraps his arm around the mast, and uses the tension as a catapult to launch himself after Spiel and Balloon. Spiel, who is quite pleased to himself, looks back to discover Luffy riding on Balloon's back, who then hops onto Spiel's broomstick. Spiel wants to know how he managed to get there, but makes the fatal mistake of grabbing Luffy's hat. Balloon flies away, which upsets Spiel even more, but Luffy assures him that he will be landing shortly, delivering a Right Hand Stopper to Spiel's face. As Luffy is being carried back by Balloon, he recalls his grandfather telling him that real treasure is not a gigantic diamond, gold, silver, coral, or pearls. Luffy wanted to know what it was then, but his grandfather told him he'd understand in time. From Balloon's back, Ann wishes Luffy luck in becoming a Peace Main, and he assures her he will. The narrator says that the pirate known as "Straw Hat Luffy" will spread his name far and wide on the sea, but that it is a story for later.

        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One Piece is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its individual chapters compiled into 100 tankōbon volumes as of September 2021. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With his crew of pirates, named the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the world's ultimate treasure known as "One Piece" in order to become the next King of the Pirates.

      <BR><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a festival film produced by Production I.G, and an anime series produced by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in Japan in 1999. Additionally, Toei has developed fourteen animated feature films, one OVA and thirteen television specials. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising and media, such as a trading card game and numerous video games. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia by Madman Entertainment. The anime series was licensed by 4Kids Entertainment for an English-language release in North America in 2004, before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by Funimation in 2007.

      <BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One Piece has received praise for its storytelling, art, characterization, and humor. Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in Japan. In 2015, One Piece set the Guinness World Record for "the most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author". It was the best-selling manga for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018. As of July 2021, the manga had over 490 million copies in circulation in 58 countries and regions worldwide, making it the best-selling manga series in history. One Piece is also one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.

      <BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy, a young man who, inspired by his childhood idol and powerful pirate "Red Haired" Shanks, sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the titular treasure and proclaim himself the King of the Pirates. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates,[Jp 1] Luffy rescues and befriends a swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search of the One Piece. They are joined in their journey by Nami, a navigator and thief; Usopp, a sniper and a pathological liar; and Vinsmoke Sanji, a perverted chef. They acquire a ship named the Going Merry[Jp 2] and engage in confrontations with notorious pirates of the East Blue. As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including Tony Tony Chopper, a doctor and anthropomorphized reindeer; Nico Robin, an archaeologist and former assassin; Franky, a cyborg shipwright; Brook, a skeletal musician and swordsman; and Jimbei, a fish-man helmsman and former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Once the Going Merry becomes damaged beyond repair, the Straw Hat Pirates acquire a new ship named the Thousand Sunny.[Jp 3] Together, they encounter other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents and soldiers of the corrupt World Government, and various other friends and foes, as they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreams.
