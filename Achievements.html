      &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After seeing the original Weekly Shônen Jump Issue with Oda’s second version of Romance Dawn and Oda’s One Shot where he became runner-up of the Tezuka Award, let’s take a look at the 1994 compilation volume of the award-winning Hop☆Step Manga Awards’ One Shots. For those of you keeping count: this was Oda’s second major competition and first win. Oda’s second application to a manga competition was when he was 18-19 years old. In 1993, Oda sent in a One Shot called “Ikki Yakô!” for the Hop☆Step Award, another award aimed at young up-and-coming manga artists where he won first prize. The one-shot was originally published in the 1993 “Spring Special” Weekly Shônen Jump magazine (similar to the current spring issue of “Jump Next” and there it was revealed that the overall score for this One Shot was a solid 28/30. Hunter x Hunter manga hiatist/artist Yoshihiro Togashi also commented on the easy to read artstyle of Oda. Contrary to the western-themed story of the Tezuka One Shot -Wanted-, the story of Ikki Yakô is about a somewhat cowardly monk named Gukô who battles monsters in a very Usopp-y way, but manages to muster up the courage needed to get his hands dirty when he really needs to.

      &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sondermann is a cartoon character of the painter and cartoonist Bernd Pfarr, which appeared, until August 1994, in a column of the same name by the writer Simone Borowiak and, from 1987 to August 2004, regularly in the satirical magazine Titanic. Model for the name was Gerhard Sondermann, the first publisher of Titanic. Sondermann is a creation of an illustrator, who, as Bernd Pfarr himself once said, wants "to drive reality out of the pictures" (German: "den Bildern die Realität austreiben").
